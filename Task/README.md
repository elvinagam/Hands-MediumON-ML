Task and the solution to the given dataset
Worked on Google Colab. For better view, you can run the code on Colab.

It is few hours of work with about 94 f1 score. With further effort, i can make the score go up to 97+. 
With more effort and time, I d try out few methods like optimized Catboost, 3D CNNs for tabular data, TabNet, NNs, PyCaret and few other technics for better score.
